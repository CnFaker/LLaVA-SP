## Install

If you are not using Linux, do *NOT* proceed, see instructions for [macOS](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/macOS.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Windows.md).

1. Clone this repository and navigate to LLaVA folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git
cd LLaVA
```

2. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate llava
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```

3. Install additional packages for training cases
```
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### Upgrade to latest code base

```Shell
git pull
pip install -e .

# if you see some import errors when you upgrade, please try running the command below (without #)
# pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir
```

### Quick Start With HuggingFace

<details>
<summary>Example Code</summary>

```Python
from llava.model.builder import load_pretrained_model
from llava.mm_utils import get_model_name_from_path
from llava.eval.run_llava import eval_model

model_path = "liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b"

tokenizer, model, image_processor, context_len = load_pretrained_model(
    model_path=model_path,
    model_base=None,
    model_name=get_model_name_from_path(model_path)
)
```

Check out the details wth the `load_pretrained_model` function in `llava/model/builder.py`.

You can also use the `eval_model` function in `llava/eval/run_llava.py` to get the output easily. By doing so, you can use this code on Colab directly after downloading this repository.

``` python
model_path = "liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b"
prompt = "What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?"
image_file = "https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg"

args = type('Args', (), {
    "model_path": model_path,
    "model_base": None,
    "model_name": get_model_name_from_path(model_path),
    "query": prompt,
    "conv_mode": None,
    "image_file": image_file,
    "sep": ",",
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": None,
    "num_beams": 1,
    "max_new_tokens": 512
})()

eval_model(args)
```

## LLaVA Weights
Please check out our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md)(:to do) for all public LLaVA checkpoints, and the instructions of how to use the weights.


### Pretrain (feature alignment)

Please download the 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset with BLIP captions we use in the paper [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).

Pretrain takes around 5.5 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-13B on 8x A100 (80G), due to the increased resolution to 336px. It takes around 3.5 hours for LLaVA-v1.5-7B.

Training script with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2: [`pretrain.sh`](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/v1_5/pretrain.sh).

- `--mm_projector_type mlp2x_gelu`: the two-layer MLP vision-language connector.
- `--vision_tower openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336`: CLIP ViT-L/14 336px.

<details>
<summary>Pretrain takes around 20 hours for LLaVA-7B on 8x V100 (32G)</summary>

 We provide training script with DeepSpeed [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/scripts/pretrain_xformers.sh).
Tips:
- If you are using V100 which is not supported by FlashAttention, you can use the [memory-efficient attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682) implemented in [xFormers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers). Install xformers and replace `llava/train/train_mem.py` above with [llava/train/train_xformers.py](llava/train/train_xformers.py).
